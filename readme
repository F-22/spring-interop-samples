Samples demonstrating interop scenarios leveraging vFabric components

The following vFabric components (Windows releases) are required to run this sample:
-RabbitMQ (2.6.1)
-GemFire (v6.6)
-SQLFire (1.0 BETA)


Rabbit Setup Steps
1. install RabbitMQ service as per the RabbitMQ installation/getting-started instructions (recommended but not necessary: add the admin plugin, see http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)
2. start RabbitMQ service (windows Services control panel or command-line as preferred)
3. verify RabbitMQ service is running via the following command-line (switch to <rabbitDir>\sbin\):

	rabbitmqctl status

4. If mgt plugin added, nav to RabbitMQ web admin portal (http://localhost:55672  [default creds: username=guest, password=guest)

GemFire Setup Steps
1. Install GemFire as per the GemFire installation/getting-started instructions
2. copy the cache.xml file from <prj-source>\gemfire-config\ to the GemFire \bin\ folder
3. start GemFire via the following command-line (switch to <gemfireDir>\bin\):

	cacheserver start

4. verify GemFire started via the following command-line:

	cacheserver status

SQLFire Setup Steps
1. Install SQLFire as per the SQLFire installation/getting-started instructions
2. start the server via the following command-line (switch to <sqlfireDir>\bin\):

	sqlf server start -dir=<path to data dir>   [can be an empty folder to start, but *must* exist]

3. start sqlf> prompt via the following command-line:

	sqlf

4. connect to the running server via the following command-line:

	connect client 'localhost:1527'

5. run the script to create the SQLFire table and sequence via the following command-line (NOTE: path delimiters MUST be passed as "/" instead of "\"):

	run '<prj-source>/sqlfire_setup_scripts/sqlfire_create_schema.sql'

6. run the script to populate the SEQUENCE with the initial value via the following command-line:

	run '<prj-source>/sqlfire_setup_scripts/sqlfire_populate_data.sql'
